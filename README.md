# Hacker Musings of pdstat

Hello, my name is Paul and this a repo full of notes for various ctf's/hacker labs I have attempted. I write these as I attempt the challenges and these are my live thoughts. I will edit these only to correct spellings/grammar, any mistakes/rabbit holes I encounter along the way will be left as is.

A little bit about my background, I am a dev who first started out with Turbo Pascal in the late 90's age 16, I have a degree in Computer Science from which I graduated in 2004 (urgh getting old!). My day job is a mix of Java development using Spring Boot to develop RESTful microservices integrating into DB's and LDAP. With the occassional dabble in Angular frontend work when required.

I first entered the security scene around 2015 when I was asked to maintain a JAX-RS service for querying LDAP directories, this eventually evolved into getting involved with IDAM/IAM tasks. These days I have a decent amount of experience in configuring access management products such as Okta/Microfocus NetIQ Access Manager using OIDC/OAuth2.0, SAML1.1 and SAML2.0. I've also developed applications to integrate into these using React/Angular SPA's for OIDC and Spring Security based applications to act as SAML2.0 service providers.

Hacking first took my interest around the 2015/2016 mark when my company sent me on a week long course on web app hacking with the aim to learn secure development practices. It involved a number of very simple CTF's which fascinated me and I quickly took to. Stupidly I procrastinated on this for a number of years after this, I did have a 1 year old and 5 year old to look after though so perhaps that had something to do with it too :)

Roll forward to January 2022 and I finally push myself to pick up where I left off. My current goal as I write is just to learn as much as I can and see where it takes me. If I can pick up the odd bounty along the way then that'll be a bonus, I'm not under the illusion of becoming the next BB millionaire as this is a tough game with a lot of competition with people who have a lot more experience. Onwards and upwards :)
